## Exercise 1 (Using `lm`)

For this exercise we will use the `cats` dataset from the `MASS` package. You should use `?cats` to learn about the background of this dataset.

**(a)** Suppose we would like to understand the size of a cat's heart based on the body weight of a cat. Fit a simple linear model in `R` that accomplishes this task. Store the results in a variable called `cat_model`. Output the result of calling `summary()` on `cat_model`.
```{r}
library(MASS)
cat_model = lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)
summary(cat_model)
```

**(b)** Output only the estimated regression coefficients. Interpret $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\beta_1$ in the *context of the problem*. Be aware that only one of those is an estimate.
```{r}
coef(cat_model)
```

The beta_0_hat of this problem means that a cat that weighs 0kg is expected to have a heart of -0.3566624g. The Beta_1 is 4.0340627, for every 4.0340627kg a cat weighs, its heart is expected to weigh an additional 1g.

**(c)** Use your model to predict the heart weight of a cat that weights **3.1** kg. Do you feel confident in this prediction? Briefly explain.
```{r}
predict(cat_model, data.frame(Bwt = 3.1))
range(cats$Bwt)
```

I feel confident in this prediction since the Body Weight measurement in the cats dataset extends beyond 3.1 kg (even includes 3.1 kg).

**(d)** Use your model to predict the heart weight of a cat that weights **1.5** kg. Do you feel confident in this prediction? Briefly explain.
```{r}
predict(cat_model, data.frame(Bwt = 1.5))
range(cats$Bwt)
```

I do not feel confident in this prediction, since the range of Bwt in the cats dataset does not extend below 2 kG (1.5 kG does not fall within the range of Bwt).

**(e)** Create a scatterplot of the data and add the fitted regression line. Make sure your plot is well labeled and is somewhat visually appealing.
```{r}
plot(Hwt ~ Bwt, cats,
     xlab = "Body Weight (kg)",
     ylab = "Heart Weight (g)",
     main = "Cat Heart Weight versus Body Weight",
     col = "dodgerblue")
abline(cat_model, col = "red")
```

**(f)** Report the value of $R^2$ for the model. Do so directly. Do not simply copy and paste the value from the full output in the console after running `summary()` in part **(a)**.

```{r}
summary(cat_model)$r.squared
```

## Exercise 2 (Writing Functions)

This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1.

**(a)** Write a function called `get_sd_est` that calculates an estimate of $\sigma$ in one of two ways depending on input to the function. The function should take three arguments as input:

- `fitted_vals` - A vector of fitted values from a model
- `actual_vals` - A vector of the true values of the response
- `mle` - A logical (`TRUE` / `FALSE`) variable which defaults to `FALSE`

The function should return a single value:

- $s_e$ if `mle` is set to `FALSE`.
- $\hat{\sigma}$ if `mle` is set to `TRUE`.
```{r}
get_sd_estimate = function(fitted_vals, actual_vals, mle = TRUE){
  n = length(fitted_vals)
  if(mle == FALSE){
    sqrt((1 / (n - 2)) * sum((actual_vals - fitted_vals) ^ 2))
  }
  else{
    sqrt((1 / n) * sum((actual_vals - fitted_vals) ^ 2))
  }
}
```

**(b)** Run the function `get_sd_est` on the residuals from the model in Exercise 1, with `mle` set to `FALSE`. Explain the resulting estimate in the context of the model.
```{r}
get_sd_estimate(fitted(cat_model), cats$Hwt, FALSE)
```

1.452373 is the standard deviation of the model. This means that 68% of cat hearts will weigh within +/- 1.452373 grams of the mean heart weight.

**(c)** Run the function `get_sd_est` on the residuals from the model in Exercise 1, with `mle` set to `TRUE`. Explain the resulting estimate in the context of the model. Note that we are trying to estimate the same parameter as in part **(b)**.
```{r}
get_sd_estimate(fitted(cat_model), cats$Hwt, TRUE)
```

1.442252 is the standard deviation of the model. This means that 68% of cat hearts will weigh within +/- 1.442252 grams of the mean heart weight.

**(d)** To check your work, output `summary(cat_model)$sigma`. It should match at least one of **(b)** or **(c)**.

```{r}
summary(cat_model)$sigma
```
'summary(cat_model)$sigma' matches b (s sub e).
***

## Exercise 3 (Simulating SLR)

Consider the model

\[
Y_i = 5 + -3 x_i + \epsilon_i
\]

with 

\[
\epsilon_i \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 10.24)
\]

where $\beta_0 = 5$ and $\beta_1 = -3$.

This exercise relies heavily on generating random observations. To make this reproducible we will set a seed for the randomization. Alter the following code to make `birthday` store your birthday in the format: `yyyymmdd`. For example, [William Gosset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset), better known as *Student*, was born on June 13, 1876, so he would use:

```{r}
birthday = 18760613
set.seed(birthday)
```

**(a)** Use `R` to simulate `n = 25` observations from the above model. For the remainder of this exercise, use the following "known" values of $x$.

```{r}
x = runif(n = 25, 0, 10)

sim_slr = function(x, beta_0 = 10, beta_1 = 5, sigma = 1) {
  n = length(x)
  epsilon = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = sigma)
  y = beta_0 + beta_1 * x + epsilon
  data.frame(predictor = x, response = y)
}

set.seed(1)
sim_data = sim_slr(x = x, beta_0 = 5, beta_1 = -3, sigma = sqrt(10.24))
```

You may use [the `sim_slr ` function provided in the text](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/simple-linear-regression.html#simulating-slr). Store the data frame this function returns in a variable of your choice. Note that this function calls $y$ `response` and $x$ `predictor`.

**(b)** Fit a model to your simulated data. Report the estimated coefficients. Are they close to what you would expect? Briefly explain.
```{r}
coef(lm(response ~ predictor, data = sim_data))
```

The coefficients are close to what we would expect. This is because the Beta_0 value is 5 (close to 5.066602) and the Beta_1 value is -3 (close to -2.968470).

**(c)** Plot the data you simulated in part **(a)**. Add the regression line from part **(b)** as well as the line for the true model. Hint: Keep all plotting commands in the same chunk.
```{r}
plot(response ~ predictor, sim_data,
    xlab = "Predictor (simulated 'x' values)",
    ylab = "Response (simulated 'y' values)",
    main = "Simulated Data",
    col = "dodgerblue")
abline(lm(response ~ predictor, data = sim_data),
       col = "orange")
abline(5, -3, lty = 2)
legend("topright", legend = c("Estimated", "True Model"), lty = 1:2, col = c("orange", "black"))
```

**(d)** Use `R` to repeat the process of simulating `n = 25` observations from the above model $1500$ times. Each time fit a SLR model to the data and store the value of $\hat{\beta_1}$ in a variable called `beta_hat_1`. Some hints:

- Consider a `for` loop.
- Create `beta_hat_1` before writing the `for` loop. Make it a vector of length $1500$ where each element is `0`.
- Inside the body of the `for` loop, simulate new $y$ data each time. Use a variable to temporarily store this data together with the known $x$ data as a data frame.
- After simulating the data, use `lm()` to fit a regression. Use a variable to temporarily store this output.
- Use the `coef()` function and `[]` to extract the correct estimated coefficient.
- Use `beta_hat_1[i]` to store in elements of `beta_hat_1`.
- See the notes on [Distribution of a Sample Mean](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/introduction-to-r.html#distribution-of-a-sample-mean) for some inspiration.

You can do this differently if you like. Use of these hints is not required.
```{r}
beta_hat_1 = rep(0, 1500)
for(i in 0:1500){
  sim_data = sim_slr(x = x, beta_0 = 5, beta_1 = -3, sigma = sqrt(10.24))
  regression = lm(response ~ predictor, data = sim_data)
  beta_hat_1[i] = coef(regression)[2]
}
```

**(e)** Report the mean and standard deviation of `beta_hat_1`. Do either of these look familiar?
```{r}
mean(beta_hat_1)
sd(beta_hat_1)
```

The mean of beta_hat_1 is very close to beta_1 (-3).

**(f)** Plot a histogram of `beta_hat_1`. Comment on the shape of this histogram.
```{r}
hist(beta_hat_1, 
     col = "blue", 
     border = "red")
```
The shape of this histogram is a bell curve. This is a normal distribution.
***

## Exercise 4 (Be a Skeptic)

Consider the model

\[
Y_i = 3 + 0 \cdot x_i + \epsilon_i
\]

with

\[
\epsilon_i \sim N(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 4)
\]

where $\beta_0 = 3$ and $\beta_1 = 0$.

Before answering the following parts, set a seed value equal to **your** birthday, as was done in the previous exercise.

```{r}
birthday = 19950419
set.seed(birthday)
```

**(a)** Use `R` to repeat the process of simulating `n = 75` observations from the above model $2500$ times. For the remainder of this exercise, use the following "known" values of $x$.

```{r}
x = runif(n = 75, 0, 10)
```

Each time fit a SLR model to the data and store the value of $\hat{\beta_1}$ in a variable called `beta_hat_1`. You may use [the `sim_slr ` function provided in the text](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/simple-linear-regression.html#simulating-slr). Hint: Yes $\beta_1 = 0$.
```{r}
beta_hat_1 = rep(0, 2500)
for(i in 0:2500){
  sim_data = sim_slr(x = x, beta_0 = 3, beta_1 = 0, sigma = sqrt(4))
  regression = lm(response ~ predictor, data = sim_data)
  beta_hat_1[i] = coef(regression)[2]
}
```

**(b)** Plot a histogram of `beta_hat_1`. Comment on the shape of this histogram.
```{r}
hist(beta_hat_1, col = "blue", border = "red")
```

The shape of this histogram is a bell curve. It is a normal distribution.

**(c)** Import the data in [`skeptic.csv`](skeptic.csv) and fit a SLR model. The variable names in `skeptic.csv` follow the same convention as those returned by `sim_slr()`. Extract the fitted coefficient for $\beta_1$.
```{r}
skeptic_data = read.csv("~/Desktop/MCS Program/Summer 2021 Classes/STAT420/HW2/skeptic.csv")
model = lm(response ~ predictor, data = skeptic_data)
c = coef(model)[2]
c
```

**(d)** Re-plot the histogram from **(b)**. Now add a vertical red line at the value of $\hat{\beta_1}$ in part **(c)**. To do so, you'll need to use `abline(v = c, col = "red")` where `c` is your value.
```{r}
hist(beta_hat_1, col = "blue", border = "red")
abline(v = c, col = "red")
```

**(e)** Your value of $\hat{\beta_1}$ in **(c)** should be negative. What proportion of the `beta_hat_1` values is smaller than your $\hat{\beta_1}$? Return this proportion, as well as this proportion multiplied by `2`.
```{r}
pnorm(c, mean = mean(beta_hat_1), sd = sd(beta_hat_1))
2 * pnorm(c, mean = mean(beta_hat_1), sd = sd(beta_hat_1))
```

**(f)** Based on your histogram and part **(e)**, do you think the [`skeptic.csv`](skeptic.csv) data could have been generated by the model given above? Briefly explain.

Skeptic.csv most likely did not generate the model above as the beta_hat_1 is on the tail end of the normal distribution.

***

## Exercise 5 (Comparing Models)

For this exercise we will use the `Ozone` dataset from the `mlbench` package. You should use `?Ozone` to learn about the background of this dataset. You may need to install the `mlbench` package. If you do so, do not include code to install the package in your `R` Markdown document.

For simplicity, we will perform some data cleaning before proceeding.

```{r}
library(mlbench)
data(Ozone, package = "mlbench")
Ozone = Ozone[, c(4, 6, 7, 8)]
colnames(Ozone) = c("ozone", "wind", "humidity", "temp")
Ozone = Ozone[complete.cases(Ozone), ]
```

We have:

- Loaded the data from the package
- Subset the data to relevant variables
    - This is not really necessary (or perhaps a good idea) but it makes the next step easier
- Given variables useful names
- Removed any observation with missing values
    - This should be given much more thought in practice

For this exercise we will define the "Root Mean Square Error" of a model as

\[
\text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}.
\]

**(a)** Fit three SLR models, each with "ozone" as the response. For the predictor, use "wind speed," "humidity percentage," and "temperature" respectively. For each, calculate $\text{RMSE}$ and $R^2$. Arrange the results in a markdown table, with a row for each model. Suggestion: Create a data frame that stores the results, then investigate the `kable()` function from the `knitr` package.
```{r}
wind_model = lm(ozone ~ wind, data = Ozone)
humidity_model = lm(ozone ~ humidity, data = Ozone)
temp_model = lm(ozone ~ temp, data = Ozone)

R2_wind = summary(wind_model)$r.squared
R2_humidity = summary(humidity_model)$r.squared
R2_temp = summary(temp_model)$r.squared

n = length(Ozone$ozone)

R2_list = c(R2_wind, R2_humidity, R2_temp)

RMSE_wind = sqrt((1 / n) * sum((resid(wind_model)) ^ 2))
RMSE_humidity = sqrt((1 / n) * sum((resid(humidity_model)) ^ 2))
RMSE_temp = sqrt((1 / n) * sum((resid(temp_model)) ^ 2))
                 
RMSE_list = c(RMSE_wind, RMSE_humidity, RMSE_temp)
                 
table = data.frame(Predictor = c("Wind", "Humidity", "Temp"),
                   "RMSE" = RMSE_list,
                   "R2" = R2_list)

knitr::kable(table)
```

**(b)** Based on the results, which of the three predictors used is most helpful for predicting ozone readings? Briefly explain.

A lower RSME value means the fit is better. Because of this, temperature is the most helpful predictor for predicting ozone readings.

## Exercise 00 (SLR without Intercept)

**This exercise will _not_ be graded and is simply provided for your information. No credit will be given for the completion of this exercise. Give it a try now, and be sure to read the solutions later.**

Sometimes it can be reasonable to assume that $\beta_0$ should be 0. That is, the line should pass through the point $(0, 0)$. For example, if a car is traveling 0 miles per hour, its stopping distance should be 0! (Unlike what we saw in the book.)

We can simply define a model without an intercept,

\[
Y_i = \beta x_i + \epsilon_i.
\]

**(a)** [In the **Least Squares Approach** section of the text](http://daviddalpiaz.github.io/appliedstats/simple-linear-regression.html#least-squares-approach) you saw the calculus behind the derivation of the regression estimates, and then we performed the calculation for the `cars` dataset using `R`. Here you need to do, but not show, the derivation for the slope only model. You should then use that derivation of $\hat{\beta}$ to write a function that performs the calculation for the estimate you derived. 

In summary, use the method of least squares to derive an estimate for $\beta$ using data points $(x_i, y_i)$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots n$. Simply put, find the value of $\beta$ to minimize the function

\[
f(\beta)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\beta x_{i})^{2}.
\]

Then, write a function `get_beta_no_int` that takes input:

- `x` - A predictor variable
- `y` - A response variable

The function should then output the $\hat{\beta}$ you derived for a given set of data.
```{r}
get_beta_no_int = function(x, y){
  sum(x * y) / sum(x ^ 2)
}
```

**(b)** Write your derivation in your `.Rmd` file using TeX. Or write your derivation by hand, scan or photograph your work, and insert it into the `.Rmd` as an image. See the [RMarkdown documentation](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for working with images.

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/alec/Desktop/MCS Program/Summer 2021 Classes/STAT420/HW2/Derive.png")
```

**(c)** Test your function on the `cats` data using body weight as `x` and heart weight as `y`. What is the estimate for $\beta$ for this data?
```{r}
get_beta_no_int(cats$Bwt, cats$Hwt)
```

**(d)** Check your work in `R`. The following syntax can be used to fit a model without an intercept:

Use this to fit a model to the `cat` data without an intercept. Output the coefficient of the fitted model. It should match your answer to **(c)**.

```{r}
cat_data = lm(cats$Hwt ~ 0 + cats$Bwt, data = cats)
coef(cat_data)
```
